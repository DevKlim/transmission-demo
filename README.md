## Simulating and Visualizing Disease Outbreaks: A Geospatial Data Science Approach




##### Kliment Ho, Jenny Xu, Owen Shi, Ashley Chu, (DSC190 Visualizing Spatial Transmission)

### Introduction
To envision a model that encapsulates the spread of infectious diseases through geospatial transmission patterns would significantly improve detection speeds of certain outbreaks amongst vulnerable communities. Such a model would integrate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with epidemiological models to simulate how an outbreak evolves across different locations. Functionality-wise, the model would simulate disease outbreaks on maps, analyze the vulnerabilities of specific urban areas, and account for different transmission types (e.g. airborne aerosols vs. respiratory droplets). In aid of distinguishing transmission modalities, the model can adjust how far and fast infections spread. Heavy droplets tend to cause local clusters, whereas aerosolized pathogens can disperse more widely ​(pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Through interactive visualizations and scenario modeling, public health officials could identify likely “hotspots” such as densely populated neighborhoods or transit hubs. This geospatial approach is vital because timely mapping of disease spread enables faster, targeted interventions, ultimately saving lives[“Dating back to 1854, the seminal work of John Snow illustrates the power of mapping and geographic systems to respond to the cholera outbreak”](who.int). Indeed, ever since John Snow’s 1854 cholera map, mapping has been a powerful tool for outbreak response, helping to pinpoint sources and inform policy​[](who.int). In modern times, with growing urban populations and global travel, such tools are even more important – new megacities can become incubators for epidemics, underscoring the need for surveillance and planning in urban settings[“”]​(pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Overall, this service aims to improve outbreak preparedness by providing data-driven insights into how diseases propagate through cities under various conditions.
Strengths
Why this system is needed – Early detection & response: Fast detection of outbreaks in their early stages is a key factor in controlling infectious diseases​
(pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). A geospatial simulation system would allow authorities to recognize unusual case clusters as soon as they emerge in a city. Early warning enables quicker quarantines, contact tracing, or resource deployment, potentially containing an outbreak before it explodes. History shows that identifying outbreaks early (and in the right location) dramatically improves the efficiency of response measures​ (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). By visualizing the spread on a map in real time, officials can intuitively see where to focus interventions.
Rich datasets available for modeling: Fortunately, there is ample data to fuel this service. Historical epidemiological datasets from organizations like the CDC and WHO document past outbreaks and disease incidence by location. For example, one global study assembled a 33-year dataset of 12,102 outbreaks across 215 diseases, totaling over 44 million cases in 219 countries​ (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Such archives provide realistic baseline patterns for the model. In addition, geospatial data sources are widely available – from population density maps and census demographics to human mobility data (e.g. commuting flows, airline networks). Integrating these can greatly enhance simulations. A recent project, for instance, combined disease dynamics with regional commuting patterns and worldwide airline traffic to model how a virus might spread from a single city globally​ (nightingaledvs.com). These diverse data layers (health, mobility, environmental) enable the system to mimic real-world conditions. GIS databases also supply information on geography and infrastructure (roads, transit lines, hospitals), which helps simulate how an illness moves through an urban environment. In short, the data foundation is strong: abundant historical case data, plus contextual datasets (climate, travel, socioeconomic factors) to inform accurate, granular outbreak modeling.
Building on proven models and tools: Another strength is that this service can leverage existing research and technology in disease modeling. Epidemiologists have already developed a variety of mathematical models (SEIR models, agent-based simulations) and there is prior work visualizing pathogen spread. A myriad of new tools and algorithms have been developed in recent years to help analyze and visualize complex infectious disease data, often incorporating GIS mapping and even molecular or network data​ (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). For example, the open-source GleamViz simulator has been used to model global epidemics, and its outputs include geo-visualizations of virus propagation​ (nightingaledvs.com). During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw numerous dashboards and heatmaps (e.g. the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 map) that successfully communicated the spread in near real-time. These precedents demonstrate that pathogen spread visualization and predictive analytics are feasible, and they have proven valuable for public health decision-making. Our proposed service stands on the shoulders of this prior work – it would unify and extend these modeling techniques into a single platform focused on geospatial outbreak simulation. The technical community and literature provide a head start in algorithms (like clustering of disease cases, risk mapping, etc.), which can be adapted to distinguish different transmission routes or urban layouts. In summary, the need for a geospatial outbreak simulator is clear, the data to power it are available, and prior models have shown the potential of mapping and analytics to predict disease spread.
Weaknesses
Despite its promise, there are inherent challenges and weaknesses in developing and deploying a large-scale geospatial outbreak simulation system:
Big data handling and computational load… Modeling an entire city or multiple cities in high detail (down to neighborhoods or individual agents) produces enormous amounts of spatial-temporal data. Processing these data in real time or running many simulations (for different scenarios or stochastic iterations) requires significant computational power. Handling large-scale spatial data efficiently is difficult, often necessitating distributed computing or specialized databases. For example, agent-based models (which simulate individuals in a population) demand high computational power, making real-time results hard to achieve without a supercomputing infrastructure​ [“Econometric models are used if one is interested in understanding and predicting where and why people move to certain regions. Gravity models, for example, are highly flexible and interpretable. They can be used to infer the reasons of displacement to different regions in the interests of preparedness”] (internal-displacement.org). If the system isn’t optimized, it may struggle with slow performance or outages when data volumes spike (e.g. during a fast-moving outbreak). Ensuring the platform can ingest live feeds (like daily case reports or mobility updates) and update simulations quickly is a non-trivial technical hurdle.


Complexity of modeling diverse environments: Infectious disease dynamics are influenced by a tangle of factors – from human behavior and biology to geography and climate. Accurately modeling pathogen behavior across different terrains and demographics is extremely complex. A model that works well for one city (with a certain population density, climate, and cultural practices) might need extensive recalibration for another region. Within urban areas, there is heterogeneity: modern cities contain high-rise downtowns, suburban sprawls, and impoverished slums, all of which experience disease spread differently. For instance, overcrowded slum neighborhoods with poor sanitation can become intense breeding grounds for infections​ (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), whereas spread in a spacious suburban area might be slower. Capturing these nuances requires numerous parameters and data inputs (contact rates, mobility patterns, immunity levels, etc.) specific to each locale and pathogen. The model also needs to account for different transmission routes – airborne diseases may be strongly influenced by ventilation or weather, while vector-borne diseases depend on local mosquito ecology. Incorporating all these elements without making the model intractably complicated is a major challenge. Moreover, as we add complexity, it becomes harder to validate the model or to explain its predictions to decision-makers.


High requirements for expertise and resources: Developing and maintaining this kind of geospatial analytic system demands a multi-disciplinary team and substantial resources. Skills in epidemiology, data science, GIS, and software engineering are all needed, which can be a barrier for health departments that don’t already have such capacity. Running large simulations or processing big geospatial datasets may also require cloud computing infrastructure or high-performance clusters, which come with financial costs. There is also a learning curve for public health users to interpret and trust the model outputs. In many places, spatial data and advanced analytics are not yet routinely used in disease surveillance​ (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), indicating a gap in training and integration. Without dedicated funding and training programs, the system might be underutilized or implemented incorrectly. In summary, the sophistication of the tool is a double-edged sword – it offers detailed insights, but only if we overcome the technical and human-capital challenges inherent in big data geospatial modeling.


Opportunities
The context and timing are favorable for this outbreak simulation service, with several opportunities that could be leveraged…
Broad stakeholder interest in outbreak analytics: The threat of pandemics has made many organizations eager for better predictive tools. Public health agencies (local departments, CDC, WHO) would `t from simulations to improve planning and allocate resources proactively. Governments at all levels have mandates to protect public health and now recognize the value of data-driven early warning systems. There is also significant private-sector interest – pharmaceutical and biotech firms, hospitals, and even companies in other sectors want to understand and mitigate the impact of disease outbreaks on their operations. For example, some companies have started using AI-based surveillance to get early alerts on emerging epidemics. BlueDot, a health analytics company, works with clients ranging from government organizations to vaccine manufacturers, providing them with infectious disease intelligence so they can respond faster [“‘We are using modern digital technologies and artificial intelligence to identify threats faster, to understand them, and assess their risks and to empower our clients to be able to respond effectively and efficiently,’ Kamran Khan, MD, CEO and Founder at BlueDot…”]​ (contagionlive.com). This indicates a market demand: if our system can improve outbreak detection or forecast areas of risk, stakeholders are willing to invest. The business incentives align with public good here – containing an outbreak not only saves lives but also reduces economic losses. A city or company that can avoid a full-blown epidemic through early action stands to benefit financially. Thus, partnerships or funding from both public institutions and private companies are realistic opportunities to support the development of this service.


Technological advancements to boost performance: We can harness cutting-edge tech to address some of the current limitations. Advances in AI and machine learning provide new methods for pattern recognition and predictive modeling that could enhance outbreak simulations. For instance, anomaly detection algorithms could sift through real-time health data to flag early signs of an unusual cluster, and clustering methods could automatically identify spatial groupings of high vulnerability or high transmission areas. Modern AI can also optimize model parameters or suggest which factors (population density, mobility, climate, etc.) are most driving the spread, thereby improving accuracy. Additionally, the rise of cloud computing and big-data frameworks means the computational efficiency of handling large-scale simulations is improving. It is increasingly feasible to run complex models on cloud platforms that auto-scale resources as needed. This could mitigate the earlier weakness of high computational demands. There are also specialized epidemiological modeling platforms (like GLEAM, used in research​
(nightingaledvs.com) and mapping libraries that we can build upon. By integrating these with our system, we reduce development time and leverage proven optimizations. Visualization technology is another area of opportunity: interactive dashboards, 3D city maps, and AR/VR could all be employed to make the simulation outputs more intuitive and actionable for users. In summary, current trends in data science and software (AI, cloud GIS, interactive visualization) can be tapped to maximize the system’s effectiveness and efficiency. With the right approach, our outbreak simulator could analyze far more data, much faster, than was possible just a few years ago.


Growing datasets and multi-source data fusion: Beyond traditional health data, new data streams are becoming available that present an opportunity for richer analysis. For example, anonymized mobile phone location data or social media trends can serve as proxy indicators of disease spread or public behavior. Environmental sensors and satellite imagery (for climate factors, population movements, etc.) can also be layered into geospatial analyses. As data sharing improves, we might access detailed city-level vulnerability indexes or maps of health system capacity. Combining over 40+ indicators at neighborhood resolution is now achievable, as demonstrated by initiatives that visualize social vulnerability within cities​
(weforum.org). By supplementing epidemiological models with these diverse data, the service could identify hidden correlations (like how public transit usage correlates with flu spread, or how social connectivity influences virus transmission). Such insights can open new intervention strategies. This data fusion opportunity means our service could evolve into a one-stop platform that not only simulates disease spread but also pinpoints why certain areas are at risk (e.g. due to high population churn, low vaccination rates, etc.). This depth of analysis would greatly appeal to urban planners and public health strategists looking for targeted solutions.


Threats
It is important to recognize potential threats and obstacles that could jeopardize the success of this geospatial outbreak simulation service:
> Data quality and availability issues… Akin to many data engineering problems, finding “quality data” to fit the model is hard to come by. Especially attempting to concatenate various different pathogen datasets under one united project will prove to be extremely time-consuming and difficult. Disease surveillance data can be incomplete, delayed, or biased. Some regions have limited testing or reporting infrastructure(usually common in cities of low economic status), so the system might be blind to outbreaks in those areas until they grow large. Additionally, there are instances where governments or organizations may under-report or conceal outbreak data for political or economic reasons. Past analyses have shown that delays in outbreak reporting often stem not from lack of capacity, but from lack of willingness due to perceived economic/political costs of disclosure​ (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). If key data streams are shut off or manipulated, the model’s forecasts will be unreliable. Moreover, historical outbreak records have not always been stored in accessible formats for analysis​ (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), which could limit the training data available for our algorithms. This threat means we must plan for uncertainty – the system should be robust to patchy data and perhaps incorporate techniques to estimate or interpolate missing information.


> Model uncertainty and potential inaccuracies. Data is large and complex. Models are simplifications of complex equations and trying to fit a model around pathogen spread is difficult to account for all the nuances in person-to-person contact/transmission. Misleading results could occur in due to underlying assumptions or inputs are wrong. For example, an incorrect estimate of how transmissible a new pathogen is (R₀ value) or an unforeseen change in human behavior (like a sudden lockdown or mass gathering) could cause the forecast to be off. Over-reliance on model output without considering its confidence intervals might lead to poor decisions. In the worst case, a false sense of security from a model prediction could delay necessary action, or conversely a false alarm could cause unnecessary panic or economic damage. This is a known challenge in predictive analytics – balancing trust and healthy skepticism. Rigorous validation and the inclusion of uncertainty ranges in the output are necessary to mitigate this, but the threat of error is impossible to eliminate completely. Stakeholders will need to understand that the tool provides scenarios, not certainties.


> Ethical and privacy concerns… The use of detailed geospatial data on populations can raise privacy issues and public concern. If the service incorporates mobility data from smartphones, even anonymized, there are questions about consent and the proper use of such information. There have been vigorous debates over digital contact tracing and location tracking during COVID-19, showing that a portion of the public (and advocacy groups) are wary of surveillance tools. We will need to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and ethical guidelines. This includes transparently communicating what data is used and how, securing any personally identifiable information, and possibly allowing individuals to opt out. There is also an ethics aspect in how the results are used – for instance, if a city is labeled “highly vulnerable,” it could face stigma or economic repercussions. Experts have called for comprehensive guidelines to safeguard users in geospatial health applications, to prevent misuse of data or misinformation​
(pursuit.unimelb.edu.au). If these concerns are not addressed, we could face public backlash or legal challenges that threaten the project.


> Resistance to transparency and intervention could lead to the same stakeholders who stand to benefit might also pose a threat if the insights from the system are politically inconvenient. Government officials might resist acting on model forecasts that suggest unpopular actions (like restricting travel to a certain city). Some may also object to the publication of vulnerability analyses that make their jurisdiction look bad. For instance, a map highlighting a country’s poor outbreak control could be seen as embarrassing, leading to reluctance in sharing data or implementing the tool.
> Institutional inertia or politics could thus undermine the adoption of the service. Close collaboration and trust-building with authorities will be required to mitigate this threat. We should frame the tool as supportive (aiding their decision-making) rather than as an external critic. Even so, in some cases, the lack of political will to act on disease intelligence remains a real risk that could limit the impact of our service.
> Financial and infrastructural constraints: Finally, the cost of deploying and maintaining this system could be a threat, especially in low-resource settings that ironically might need it most. If ongoing funding is not secured, the project could stall. Similarly, not all regions have the tech infrastructure (reliable internet, GIS software, trained staff) to utilize the platform fully. As noted by WHO, many countries currently lack the benefits of GIS in their health information systems​[“Dating back to 1854, the seminal work of John Snow illustrates the power of mapping and geographic systems to respond to the cholera outbreak. ”]. This could create a digital divide where only well-off cities get advanced outbreak modeling, potentially widening global health disparities. To counter this, we might explore partnerships (e.g. grants for software licenses, cloud credits, etc. as WHO has done​… e.g. [“WHO hosts GIS software (ArcGIS and QGIS) for use by countries, partners and WHO staff. In 2017, WHO signed an Esri Enterprise Agreement to make the ArcGIS software available to WHO staff and provides access to QGIS to all countries and partners. WHO also facilitates the Esri Health and Human Services grant program to provide free software licenses for 2 years to 75 low-and middle-income countries”], who.int) so that vulnerable regions can also access the tool. Nonetheless, budget cuts or shifting priorities at partner organizations remain an ever-present threat to long-term projects. We should design the service to demonstrate clear value (cost saved by preventing an outbreak) to justify its expense, increasing the likelihood of sustained support.


Conclusion and Takeaways
In conclusion, our SWOT analysis of a geospatial disease outbreak simulation service highlights a high-impact idea with both significant promise and notable challenges. On the strengths side, we have a pressing need for better outbreak prediction, a wealth of available data, and proven modeling techniques to build upon. The weaknesses warn us that building such a system is complex – it must handle big data and diverse scenarios, and it requires considerable expertise and computing resources. Opportunities abound in terms of stakeholder interest (from public health agencies to private biotech firms) and technological advancements (AI, big data tools) that we can leverage to enhance the system. Meanwhile, the threats remind us to tread carefully regarding data limitations, accuracy, privacy, politics, and funding sustainability.
Key takeaways include:
Transmission mode matters: Different transmission types dramatically influence how an outbreak spreads spatially. Our analysis reinforces that the model must account for these differences – for example, respiratory droplets generally settle quickly, limiting spread to close contacts​(pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), whereas airborne pathogens can float and travel further, potentially infecting people across a wider area (especially indoors with poor ventilation). By incorporating disease-specific transmission characteristics, the service can more accurately predict outbreak footprints for airborne diseases (like measles or COVID-19) versus contact-borne diseases (like norovirus or Ebola). This differentiation allows public health responders to tailor interventions (e.g. improving airflow in the case of an airborne threat, or focusing on surface disinfection and contact tracing for droplet/contact spread).


Identifying vulnerable urban areas: Cities are not monolithic – certain neighborhoods or demographic groups are far more vulnerable to severe outbreaks. We saw that factors such as population density, poverty, and connectivity contribute to a community’s risk. For instance, high-density slums with limited healthcare will likely experience faster spread and worse outcomes, as evidenced by higher disease rates observed in such settings​ (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Conversely, communities with robust healthcare and social networks may be more resilient. By simulating outbreaks at fine geographic scales, the system can highlight these disparities. It could pinpoint, say, five cities worldwide (or districts within a city) that are most likely to suffer in a given pandemic scenario. Decision-makers can then prioritize strengthening those weak points (through vaccination drives, public education, stockpiling resources, etc.). Understanding which cities or neighborhoods are “hot zones” for rapid disease transmission helps optimize preparedness and ensures help is directed where it’s needed most.


Optimizing geospatial analytics for public health: The project underscores how powerful geospatial analysis can be for public health, but also that investments in computational efficiency and data integration are crucial. Handling city-scale simulations with millions of agents or multiple data layers pushes the limits of conventional analysis, so embracing modern techniques (parallel computing, cloud-based GIS, real-time data pipelines) is necessary for success. The takeaway for stakeholders (governments, NGOs, funders) is that improving the tech infrastructure for epidemic modeling is a wise investment. It will pay dividends by enabling faster analyses during health crises. We encourage continued support for initiatives that enhance the scale and speed of spatial data processing in epidemiology. This includes training more data scientists in public health, adopting open data standards for sharing outbreak information, and ensuring privacy-preserving methods are in place so that data can be used responsibly. With these improvements, geospatial outbreak simulations can become a standard part of the public health toolkit – a bridge between big data and life-saving action.


In closing, while there are challenges to overcome, the development of a simulation and visualization service for disease outbreaks holds great promise for improving how we respond to epidemics. By marrying epidemiology with geospatial data science, we gain a powerful lens to see when, where, and how quickly a disease might spread, and to identify the points of vulnerability in our urban landscapes. This knowledge is invaluable for crafting proactive interventions and informed policies. As we have learned from recent pandemics, time and information are of the essence in outbreak response. A system that delivers both – fast and insightful analytics on disease spread – could very literally save lives. Therefore, investing in the computational, data, and collaborative resources to realize this vision is an investment in a healthier, more resilient future for cities worldwide.
Outline for oral prez
Introduction
Definition & Purpose: Introduce the data science service as a GIS-based disease outbreak simulator. Explain how it models disease spread over geography, incorporating transmission modes (airborne vs droplet) and highlighting vulnerable urban areas.
Real-world Motivation: Emphasize why this matters – rapid urban outbreaks (e.g. COVID-19) show the need for tools that can project how a disease moves through a city. Mapping outbreaks can guide timely interventions (recall John Snow’s cholera map example).
Key Features: Mention that the service will simulate outbreaks on interactive maps, differentiate transmission types, and identify hotspots in cities for targeted response.
Strengths (SWOT)
Urgent Need: Early outbreak detection and visualization can save lives by enabling prompt responses. If we catch clusters early (via data signals on a map), we can contain disease spread before it explodes​

Data Availability: We have rich datasets from CDC, WHO, etc., plus GIS data (population density, mobility patterns). These give a strong foundation for modeling. E.g., decades of outbreak records (12k+ outbreaks globally) are available to train/validate the model​

Existing Models & Tools: Prior work in epidemiology and data visualization can be leveraged. There are proven models (SEIR, agent-based) and mapping tools that show disease spread (e.g., COVID-19 dashboards). This reduces development risk – we’re building on known techniques​

(Brief example to engage audience: “Think of how weather radar shows a storm’s path – we want to do that for epidemics, using all the data and models we have.”)*
Weaknesses (SWOT)
Technical Complexity: Highlight that simulating entire urban populations is computationally intensive. Big data (millions of data points) and complex dynamics mean we need significant computing power and expertise​
INTERNAL-DISPLACEMENT.ORG
The system won’t run on a simple laptop!
Model Limitations: Acknowledge that modeling disease in the real world is hard – many factors (behavior, environment) and each city is different. The model could be wrong if assumptions are off. There’s no one-size-fits-all: we’ll need to constantly update parameters for new diseases or locales.
Resource Requirements: Note that developing and using this service demands specialized skills (data science, epidemiology) and funding. Not all health departments have GIS experts or supercomputers on hand – there’s a capacity gap​ that we must find ways to fill (training, partnerships).
Opportunities (SWOT)
Stakeholder Interest: Stress that many organizations would value this system. Public health officials want better tools to predict outbreaks, and biotech/pharma companies could use it for logistics (e.g., where to send vaccines)​. This means potential partners and funding sources (government grants, industry collaborations) are available.
Advances in Tech: Exciting new technologies can be harnessed. AI and machine learning can improve predictions (by finding patterns in the data), and cloud computing can handle the heavy data crunching more efficiently. We also have modern data viz techniques to present results clearly.
Enhanced Data Integration: More data streams are coming online (social media trends, mobility data, environmental sensors). The opportunity is to fuse these with traditional health data to get a comprehensive picture. For example, combining flight data with infection models can show likely global spread routes – adding significant value to our simulations​.
(Engage the audience: “This is a timely idea. With the world’s focus on pandemics, now is the chance to build something like this – the interest and technology are there.”)*
Threats (SWOT)
Data Gaps & Accuracy: Caution that if data are poor, predictions will be poor. Some regions might under-report cases or lack surveillance, so the model could miss things​. Also, unexpected events (a superspreader event, or a government hiding an outbreak) could throw off our model.
Privacy and Ethics: Acknowledge concerns about using location and health data. We must navigate privacy laws and public perception. If people feel it’s “Big Brother” tracking them, or governments fear the transparency, they may push back​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. We’ll need strong data governance and privacy protection measures to build trust.
Political and Financial Risks: Note that adoption of the system requires political will. Some officials might resist data-driven insights that require difficult actions (like locking down neighborhoods). Financially, if budgets tighten or priorities shift, funding could dry up – a risk to any long-term project.
Mitigation: Briefly mention how we might mitigate these threats (e.g., start with pilot programs to demonstrate value, ensure compliance with privacy standards like anonymization, engage stakeholders early to secure buy-in).
Conclusion
Recap Value: Summarize that a geospatial outbreak simulation service could be a game-changer for public health, allowing us to anticipate and contain outbreaks more effectively. It ties together epidemiology, data science, and GIS to answer critical questions: Where might the disease go next? Who is most at risk?
SWOT Summary: Conclude that while there are challenges (technical and practical), the potential benefits – faster responses, lives saved, informed policies – far outweigh the weaknesses and threats, especially if we plan for them.
Takeaway Message: End with an encouraging note that investing in such data-driven tools is investing in preparedness. As outbreaks continue to threaten globally, embracing geospatial analytics will help cities become smarter and more resilient in fighting diseases. Encourage the audience (whether public officials or partners) to support initiatives that improve computational capacity and data sharing for outbreak modeling, as these will pay off in future crises.
